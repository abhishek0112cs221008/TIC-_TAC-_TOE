            <p>Tic Tac Toe PRO ("we," "our," or "us") is currently providing the Tic Tac Toe PRO application as a Free
                app. This SERVICE is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>
            <p>This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of
                Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.</p>
            <p>If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to
                this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service.
                We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
            <p>For a better experience, while using our Service, we may require you to provide us with certain
                personally identifiable information. The information that we request will be retained on your device and
                is not collected by us in any way.</p>

            <h3>Local Storage</h3>
            <p>Our app uses local storage technologies (Shared Preferences) solely for the purpose of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Saving your game progress and statistics (wins, losses, draws)</li>
                <li>Storing your app settings (such as theme preferences and sound/haptic settings)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This data is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted to us or any third-party servers.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Log Data</h2>
            <p>We want to inform you that whenever you use our Service, in a case of an error in the app we do not
                collect data and information (through third party products) on your phone called Log Data. Since this
                app operates completely offline, no crash reports or usage logs are sent to external servers.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Cookies</h2>
            <p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers.
                These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal
                memory.</p>
            <p>This Service does not use these "cookies" explicitly. The app uses local storage only for game
                functionality as described above.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Service Providers</h2>
            <p>We do not employ third-party companies or individuals due to the following reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
                <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
                <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
                <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We want to inform users of this Service that we do not share your information with any third parties.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
                acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or
                method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
                However, since all data resides locally on your device, the security of your data largely depends on the
                security of your device itself.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally
                identifiable information from children under 13. In the case we discover that a child under 13 has
                provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent
                or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact
                us so that we will be able to do necessary actions.</p>
        </section>
